# NoteClipboard
On desktop OSs like Windows, we can copy and paste text and images between softwares. For example, we can copy an image from Microsoft Word into Adobe Photoshop. However, this isn't currently possible for midi notes. So I hope we can have a clipboard data exchange format between various symbol-based music creation softwares.
